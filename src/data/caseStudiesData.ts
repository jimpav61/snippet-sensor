      "## Overview",
      "A leading healthcare network with over 20 hospitals and 200+ clinics was struggling to effectively communicate important health information to patients through digital channels. Their content was technically accurate but wasn't being surfaced effectively by AI assistants and search tools that patients increasingly relied on to find health information.",
      "## Challenges",
      "- Patient information needs were increasingly being mediated by AI assistants",
      "- Existing content was written for traditional search engines rather than AI systems",
      "- Complex medical terminology and concepts needed to be effectively communicated",
      "- Legal and compliance requirements created additional content constraints",
      "## Methodology",
